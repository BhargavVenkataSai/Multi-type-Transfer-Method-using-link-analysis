Novel approaches to problems like missing link prediction in heterogeneous networks—where connections differ among various types—have been made possible by developments in social network analysis. 
The Multi-Type Transferable Method (MTTM), a powerful deep learning system that leverages transferable feature representations to improve link prediction, is the main focus of this project. 
MTTM incorporates adversarial neural networks that consist of a discriminative classifier and a generative predictor, in contrast to conventional models that prioritise type-specific variables. 
While reducing type-specific dependencies, this synergy makes it possible to extract shared features across link types. 
The framework greatly enhances its generalisation and prediction skills across heterogeneous social networks by adapting to uncertain link types through the optimisation of a minimax two-player game mechanism.

Thorough preprocessing methods, such as feature categorisation and embedding, get the data ready for reliable training and assessment. 
In terms of accuracy, precision, and computational economy, MTTM continuously outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, according to extensive trials. 
These outcomes highlight how adaptable the approach is to dealing with the intricacies of heterogeneous networks in the real world. 
In addition to overcoming the difficulties caused by type ambiguity, the incorporation of transferable features into MTTM paves the way for more complex social analytics applications 
including anomaly detection, community identification, and network evolution modelling. 
The transformative potential of transferable learning frameworks in resolving complex link prediction problems is demonstrated in this study.
